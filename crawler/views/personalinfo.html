            <p>With the advanced development of the internet, people can no longer image life without the network. We access learning materials online, contact school officers or professors via email, use many different social platforms and use online shopping websites etc. Usually before we could use these websites, we need to fill in personal information to create new accounts, such as GitHub, LinkedIn, BestBuy, etc. </p>
            <p>Using social networking sites, such as Facebook, we can share what we want to share with all our friends in just one or two minutes. Using online shopping websites, such as Amazon, we can buy items we want without going out. The network brings us so much convenience. However, behind these logging in, sharing, shopping operations, our personal information security is threatened. 
                For example, Facebook announced on September 28 this year that 50 million accounts on their website may have been hacked (Fraud.org). For the leakage of personal information issues, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Online information security issues are becoming more and more serious along with our increasing relence on the network.</p>
            <p>Even though people's awareness of protecting information security is increasing and Internet companies are constantly improving their systems to protect user information, but there are still many reasons that make user information breach.</p>
            <p>Some small Internet companies’ systems are too weak to resist many malicious attacks on the network, or their systems have problems on their own due to lack of experience. User's information is easily hacked by hackers or directly leaked out during user using these websites. 
                Users information leakage issue on the China official train ticket website in 2014 is a good example. In fact, it was because the users whose information was leaked used third-party automated ticketing software which used plaintext to deal with user information (Liu Xin). 
                Plaintext means unencrypted information. In computer networks, in order to enhance information security, sensitive information is usually encrypted by some means. Due to lack of experience, the development engineers of the third-party software indirectly caused this incident.</p>
            <p>Besides, in the age of network information, users' information has great value. Therefore, there are always people who want to obtain user information through illegal ways to get benefits. Thus, hackers are always interest in hacking different systems to steal user information and the systems that have more users and more important user information are the best target for them. 
                For instance, Equifax which is a consumer credit reporting agency reported that it had exposure 145.5 million accounts in 2017. Exposed information included American consumers names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, and, in some cases, driver’s license numbers which are all great important information for users (LifeLock).</p>
