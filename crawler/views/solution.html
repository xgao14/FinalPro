            <p>As the personal information so important for users, the companies take measures to make sure the safety of user information is greatly necessary.</p>
            <h4>What should the Web companies do?</h4>
            <p>On the one hand, the companies to which the websites belong should consider the users' information security at their highest priority. 
                They should keep improving its defense attack system to ensure that the system can intercept large numbers of malicious attacks. 
                Moreover, advanced technical means, such as different data encrypt methods, are needed to store users' information, so that even if the hacker gets the data, the real information content cannot be parsed.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, storing the information separately is another good way to prevent user information leakage. For example, store the user name and his SSN and the credit card number in three different parts. 
                In this way, if the hacker obtains a part of information such as users name, he may not be able to obtain other information that store in different parts at the same time. It also gives the company's time to improve system and prevent being attacked again.</p>
            
            <h4>What could we do?</h4>
            <p>In addition, we, users can also take steps to protect our information. At first, the passwords for important accounts should be as complex as possible. The purpose of doing this is to make the password harder to crack.</p> 
            <p>Secondly, it is important to change password regularly. In this way, even if our account is leaked, we can get it back in time to prevent it from being used by the bad guys.</p> 
            <p>Thirdly, use additional security features, such as secondary or two-factor authentication, if the website has. For example, we will receive a text which tell us a one-time code when we enter the password and we must enter the code then we can log in (Brian X. Chen and Jonah Engel Bromwich).</p> 
            <p>Fourthly, filling as little real information as possible when creating a new account in some nonimportant websites so that minimize the risk of real information leakage.</p> 
            <p>Fifthly, avoiding opening malicious websites which always likely to cause information to be stolen. Sixthly, using fewer or none of the password-saving functions on the websites. Our brain is the safest storage.</p>   
            <br>
            <p>In a word, protecting personal information is not only the responsibility of Internet companies, but users also should always be careful when surfing the Internet. Furthermore, We need to constantly upgrade our security technologies to protect our information since the hackers won't stop to hack the systems if the information in these systems could bring them profit.</p>
